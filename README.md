### MyDnetCoreSampleAes: is a .NET Core Project

#### MyDnetCoreSampleAes.cs: 

This sample is one of the simplest forms of Asymmetric Encryption sample.

MyDnetCoreSampleAes.cs is a C# example of Symmetric Encryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) specification by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In this demo we are using .NET Core implementation of AES.  Look like (as of now) the .net core has not added support for RijndaelManaged. My original plan was to create sample with RijndaelManaged, then end up using AES though. 

The AES specification has support for a subset of the Rijndael ciphers. AES comprises three block ciphers, AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. Each cipher encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits using cryptographic keys of 128, 192 and 256bits, respectively. Whereas the Rijndael was designed to handle additional block sizes and key lengths.
